'''Example configuration file, for use with a positional tagset for Russian.
For example, a Russian word might be tagged as mis-sfm-e 
(the morphosyntactic description of the features, which is equivalent to 
main+indicative+past+singular+feminine+medial+perfective)

All configuration files must contain get_attributes, which specifies how to name features based on the target language preprocessed morphological analysis. 
This function takes a category and a tag (the output of the morphological analyzer for a given word) and yields a list of features.
The features returned by the function are used to define the target morphological feature vectors. 
Configuration files must be present in this configuration directory.

You can train a model with this configuration by running (assuming corpus is a training set in the format:
 SRC ||| SRC tag ||| SRC deps ||| TGT ||| TGT lemma ||| TGT tag ||| alignments, and rev_map is the output from rev_map.py)
 

by running (for verbs, for example)
cat corpus | python struct_train.py -r 0.01 -i 10 -c russian_config V rev_map model
