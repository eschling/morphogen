`morphogen` is a tool for improving machine translation into morphologically rich languages. It uses source context to predict inflections, and uses these inflection models to create augmented grammars that can be used with a standard decoder.

## Dependencies
While the morphogen code itself is not dependent on anything external, it is intended to be used with a number of external tools. Specifically, it is used to extend the per-sentence grammars created by [`cdec`](http://www.cdec-decoder.org). The inflection model depends on having good source side information, in the form of dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and word clustering. We do these using [TurboParser](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TurboParser/), TurboTagger, and [600 Brown clusters](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/cdyer/en-c600.gz) produced from large amounts of monolingual English data. These are all publically available. 

If no morphological segmentations are given, we use [`fast_umorph`](https://github.com/vchahun/fast_umorph) to get unsupervised morphological segmentations. This requires the [OpenFST library](http://www.openfst.org/) to be installed on your machine.

The tagging and parsing could theoretically be done with any tool. Morphogen only requires that the dependency parses are in the Stanford dependency format.

## Running

### Unsupervised

A [`ducttape`](https://github.com/jhclark/ducttape) workflow is provided in the examples folder. If you replace the dev, test, and train variables with paths to your data sets (in ` SRC ||| TGT ` bitext format), point the morphogen global variable at your clone of morphogen, specify a type file for unsupervised segmentations, and run `ducttape workflow.tape -p basic -O unsup` it will:
- clone all of the necessary external tools to your machine
- preprocess your data
- produce unsupervised morphological segmentations with [`fast_umorph`](https://github.com/vchahun/fast_umorph)(this can take time, depending on the number of iterations)
- use them to train an inflection model with stochastic gradient descent
- extract per-sentence-grammars for the dev and test sets with cdec
- augment your grammars with the inflection model
- tune your augmented system using MIRA
- evaluate your system on the given test set

The `- p basic` option says that we should run the workflow path `basic`. The `-O` option specifies the output directory for the workflow.

There is a very good, if incomplete, ducttape tutorial [here](http://nschneid.github.io/ducttape-crash-course/tutorial.html)

The corpus used with `fast_umorph` to get unsupervised segmentations must be encoded in an **8-bit format** (e.g. ISO-8859-[1-16]). If you're using our `unsupervised.tape`, this means you need to specify the correct 8-bit encoding for your target language in the global variables. The script will do the necessary conversions for you. 

The unsupervised morphological segmentations take three hyperparameters (`alpha_prefix`, `alpha_stem`, and `alpha_suffix`). We have found that `alpha_prefix, alpha_suffix << alpha_stem << 1` is necessary to produce useful segmentations. This encodes that there should be many more possible stems than there are inflectional affixes. The number of iterations necessary to produce good segmentations varies depending on the language. In general `alpha_prefix = alpha_suffix = 1e-6` , `alpha_stem = 1e-4` at 1000 iterations is a good starting point. 

You can edit the ducttape file to specify your own segmentations. Simply define a global variable that points to your segmentations and replace all references to the output of the umorph task with your variable. You do not need to remove the task. It will not run if it is not required to reach the end goal of the plan.

Format: 
token &emsp; prefix^prefix^&lt;stem&gt;^suffix^suffix
(e.g. тренинговой &emsp; <тренинг>^ов^ой)

### Supervised

We also provide a ducttape workflow for supervised models, and an example configuration file for a Russian positional tagset. If you will be training a supervised model, all of the target side preprocessing must be done by you. 
Format: ` SRC ||| TGT ||| TGT stem ||| TGT tag `

Similarly, any monolingual data must be preprocessed.
Format: ` TGT ||| TGT stem ||| TGT tag `
        
You MUST provide a Python configuration file which defines a function `get_attributes(category, attributes)`, which yields a list of features given the category and morphological inflection of a word. This file must be placed in the folder `morphogen/config_files/`. Since this function depends on the format produced by your supervised morphological analyzer, you must define it yourself. This will be used when training the inflection model to create features that can be evaluated qualitatively. There is an example configuration for a Russian positional tagset in `morphogen/config_files/russian_config.py`.

### Both

If you don't specifiy a target language model, a 4-gram language model will be created as a part of the ducttape workflow. We recommend also creating a class based target language model and using this in addition to the standard target language model. All language models must be in the KenLM format for use with `cdec`

We also provide a ducttape script for intrinsic evaluation of inflection models. This preprocesses the given development data in the same manner as the training data and evaluates our hypothesized inflections against the actual inflections. It's more of a sanity check than anything else.

To inspect the feature weights learned by a given model, use `python show_model.py model > model.features`
